# Introduction

The HP-35 was HP's first pocket calculator. It was introduced at a time when most calculators (including expensive desktop models) had only the four basic functions. The HP-35 was the first pocket calculator with transcendental functions and the first with RPN.

The calculator had a four register stack (**X**, **Y**, **Z** and **T**), the `ENTER‚Üë` key pushed the displayed value (**X**) down the stack. Any binary operation popped the top two registers, and pushed the result. When the stack was popped the **T** register duplicated into the **Z** register.

Internally, the calculator was organized around a serial (one-bit) processor chipset made under contract by Mostek, processing 56-bit floating-point numbers, representing 14-digit BCD numbers.

The calculator used a traditional floating decimal display for numbers that could be displayed in that format, but automatically switched to scientific notation for other numbers. The fifteen-digit LED display was capable of displaying a ten-digit mantissa plus its sign and a decimal point and a two-digit exponent plus its sign.
